TASK FLOW + SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS 

Task Flow is a decentralised platform that matches a freelancer to an employer according to their requiremnets for the task and the frelancer's skillset. The employers post a task with the associated payouts and prerequisites which are matched to a freelancer using a ML match-making algorithm. Sentimental Analysis is a platform that analyses the sentiment behind a product's reviews. It helps a business to understand customer preferences and sentiments to derive useful insights to review data. 
Combining Task Flow with the product review features of Sentimental Analysis, we create a multifaceted platform that allows freelancers to understand an employer's requirements for a task which lets the freelancer gain insights on how to improve their service furthering the freelancer's own skills. 

## Why
    
Employers struggle with finding the right clients and vice-versa freelancers with finding jobs that fit their skill set. This idea bridges the gap between an employer and freelancer to improve hiring efficiency while also providing feedback on the quality of work which ensures continuous improvement and advancement. 


## How 

We thought of implementing the idea by using an open source code from github and further developing it by adding improved features and the sentimental analysis element as well. 

## Challenges Faced

We initially struggled to run the github source code due to programming technicalities but later sorted it out. It was also extremely diffcult to incorporate block chain and ML for matching. 

## Good to have features

We would like to see better user friendly interface for the platform to make it easier to navigate for anybody who wants to use it. 
Statistical reports to help better assess the freelancers and their skills. 
An AI that inputs your skills and details and auto makes a resume and sends it to the respective employers.

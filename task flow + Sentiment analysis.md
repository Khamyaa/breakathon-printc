TASK FLOW + SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS 

##a short description on what the idea is 
Task Flow is a decentralised platform that matches a freelancer to an employer according to their requiremnets for the task and the frelancer's skillset. The employers post a task with the associated payouts and prerequisites which are matched to a freelancer using a ML match-making algorithm. Sentimental Analysis is a platform that analyses the sentiment behind a product's reviews. It helps a business to understand customer preferences and sentiments to derive useful insights to review data. 
Combining Task Flow with the product review features of Sentimental Analysis, we create a multifaceted platform that allows freelancers to understand an employer's requirements for a task which lets the freelancer gain insights on how to improve their service furthering the freelancer's own skills.
